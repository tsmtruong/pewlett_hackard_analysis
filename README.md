# Pewlett-Hackard SQL Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to use SQL to evaluate the employees of the company Pewlett-Hackard. Using SQL we cleaned and created queries to refine and create tables to help the company determine which employees are eligible for their retirement program, as well as which employees are in the position to be apart of the mentorship program.

- The senior level staff from all departments will see the largest impact from the retirement plan, speciffically the Engineering Department 

- Manager's will not be impacted much as only two individuals are of retirement age.

- There are over 30,000 individuals in Pewlett-Hackard that are of retirement age.

- Of the 30,000 + employees at retiring age there are 1,549 employees that are eligible to be apart of the mentorship program to train junior employees. 

## Summary

- The analysis showed that there is a severe lack of younger Senior-level staff across many areas. The upcoming "silver tsumani" might leave Pewlwett-Hackard with large learning curve if they don't address the problem immediately and strategically. Upon furthur analysis, I discovered that from the mentorship-eligible employees there are about 670 mentorship-eligible retirement-ready employees with the engineering title. Of those 670 only 169 are at the Senior-level the other 501 are listed as Engineers. This will leave a large gap in Senior-level employees that have the Engineering title as it could possibly leave 35,000 Senior Engineer positions empty in the "silver tsunami". The departments that will be the most effected in this 'silver tsunami" are the Development, Production, and Sales departments. There are over 18,000 employees eligible for retirement in the development department alone, may of which hole the Senior Eningeer title.

- I believe that it would be best for the company to start asking managers and Senior-level staff from the departments that will be effeccted the most to start electing and training willing and able junior employees who they believe will be best at filling in the Senior level roles. As well as start conducting interviews with external candidates to fill in gaps along the way as a mass promotion would leave the junior spots unfilled causing more work and stress to the newly appointed senior-level employees.
